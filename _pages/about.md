I am a Juniorprofessor for Combinatorics at Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum.
My research interest lies in the intersection between Combinatorics and Discrete Geometry, Tropical Geometry and Algebraic Geometry. The core of my research lies in polyhedral geometry, with a wide range of applications such as Machine Learning, Optimization, Economics and Game Theory. Please see the [topics](/topics/) page for detailed expositions.
