I am a PhD student in Mathematics at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences, working in the [Nonlinear Algebra group](https://www.mis.mpg.de/nlalg/research.html) under the guidance of [Rainer Sinn](http://www.math.uni-leipzig.de/~sinn/index_en.html). 

My research interest lies in Tropical Geometry, especially its combinatorial aspects and the applications to Optimization. Before coming to Leipzig, I started my PhD at Freie Universität Berlin in the research groups [Discrete Methods in Algebraic Geometry](http://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/math/groups/ag-diskret-algebra-geom/index.html) and [Discrete Geometry](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/math/groups/discgeom/index.html).
I also earned a master's degree at Freie Universität Berlin. My master thesis concerned connections of polytopes to competitive equilibria in economics and was advised by [Christian Haase](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/math/groups/ag-diskret-algebra-geom/members/Professoren/christian_haase.html).
