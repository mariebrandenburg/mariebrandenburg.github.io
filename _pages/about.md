I am a postdoc in the group of [Katharina Jochemko](https://people.kth.se/~jochemko/) at KTH in Stockholm.
My research interest lies in the intersection between Combinatorics and Discrete Geometry, Tropical Geometry and Algebraic Geometry. The core of my research lies in polyhedral geometry, with a wide range of applications such as Machine Learning, Optimization, Economics and Game Theory. Please see the [topics](/topics/) page for detailed expositions.

Until January 2024 I was a postdoc in the [Mathematical Machine Learning](https://www.mis.mpg.de/montufar/index.html) group of [Guido Mont√∫far](https://personal-homepages.mis.mpg.de/montufar/) at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences, within the DFG priority program [SPP 2298: Theoretical Foundations of Deep Learning - Combinatorial and Implicit Apporoaches to Deep Learning](https://www.foundationsofdl.de). 
I received my PhD in May 2023, which I worked on under the guidance of [Rainer Sinn](http://www.math.uni-leipzig.de/~sinn/index_en.html), and was part of the [Nonlinear Algebra Group](https://www.mis.mpg.de/nlalg/research.html) of [Bernd Sturmfels](https://math.berkeley.edu/~bernd/) at MPI MiS.
