I am a Juniorprofessor for Combinatorics at Ruhr-Universität Bochum.
My research interest lies in the intersection between Combinatorics and Discrete Geometry, Tropical Geometry and Algebraic Geometry. The core of my research lies in polyhedral geometry, with a wide range of applications such as Machine Learning, Optimization, Economics and Game Theory. Please see the [topics](/topics/) page for detailed expositions.


Before coming to Bochum, I was a postdoc in the group of [Katharina Jochemko](https://people.kth.se/~jochemko/) at KTH in Stockholm, as part of the [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)](https://wasp-sweden.org), 
and a postdoc in the [Mathematical Machine Learning](https://www.mis.mpg.de/montufar/index.html) group of [Guido Montúfar](https://personal-homepages.mis.mpg.de/montufar/) at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences, within the DFG priority program [SPP 2298: Theoretical Foundations of Deep Learning - Combinatorial and Implicit Apporoaches to Deep Learning](https://www.foundationsofdl.de). 
I received my PhD in May 2023 under the guidance of [Rainer Sinn](http://www.math.uni-leipzig.de/~sinn/index_en.html), and was part of the [Nonlinear Algebra Group](https://www.mis.mpg.de/nlalg/research.html) of [Bernd Sturmfels](https://math.berkeley.edu/~bernd/) at MPI MiS.
