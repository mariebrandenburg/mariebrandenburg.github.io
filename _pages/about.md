I am a PhD student in mathematics at Freie Universität Berlin, working in the research groups [Discrete Algebraic Geometry](http://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/math/groups/ag-diskret-algebra-geom/index.html) and [Discrete Geometry](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/math/groups/discgeom/index.html) under the guidance of [Rainer Sinn](http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/rsinn/index_en.html). 

My research is in Tropical Geometry, especially combinatorial aspects and applications to Optimazation. Before starting my PhD I earned a master's degree at FU Berlin. My master thesis was concerned with connections of polytopes to competitive equilibria in economics, advised by [Christian Haase](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/math/groups/ag-diskret-algebra-geom/members/Professoren/christian_haase.html).
