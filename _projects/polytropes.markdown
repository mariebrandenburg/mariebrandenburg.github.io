The univariate Ehrhart and \\(h^\*\\)-polynomials of lattice polytopes have been widely studied. We describe methods from toric geometry for computing multivariate versions of volume, Ehrhart and \\(h^\*\\)-polynomials of lattice polytropes, which are both tropically and classically convex. These algorithms are applied to all polytropes of dimensions 2,3 and 4, yielding a large class of integer polynomials. We give a complete combinatorial description of the coefficients of volume polynomials of 3-dimensional polytropes in terms of regular central subdivisions of the fundamental polytope. Finally, we provide a partial characterization of the analogous coefficients in dimension 4.

An implementation of the code used in this paper is can be found [in this repository.](https://github.com/mariebrandenburg/polynomials-of-polytropes) This is joint work with Sophia Elia and Leon Zhang.
