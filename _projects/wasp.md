I am part of the [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)](https://wasp-sweden.org),
Sweden's largest individual research program. WASP is a national initiative for strategically motivated basic research, education and faculty recruitment. The program addresses research on artificial intelligence and autonomous systems acting in collaboration with humans, adapting to their environment through sensors, information and knowledge, and forming intelligent systems-of-systems.
