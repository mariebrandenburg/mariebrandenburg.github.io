A combinatorial auction is an auction, in which the price and allocation of multiple goods are decided simultatiously within an instant. In the setting of *graphical valuations*, each bidder tells the auctioneer beforehands how much they would be willing to pay for each subset of goods. This valuation is controlled by a graph, for which weights on the vertices and edges define the valuation for each subset of goods. Given these valuations, the auctioneer decides a price per item and a distribution of the goods among the bidders.

 A bidder is happy with the outcome of an aution, if they receive a subset of goods at a price, which maximizes their surplus. We pose the question of the existence of a price and an allocation, at which all bidders are happy; this is a competitive equilibrium. 

 This project is based on my master thesis and joint work in progress together with [Christian Haase](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/math/groups/ag-diskret-algebra-geom/members/Professoren/christian_haase.html) and [Ngoc Mai Tran](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/ntran/).
