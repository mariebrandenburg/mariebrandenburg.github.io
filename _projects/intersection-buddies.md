We investigate the intersection body of a convex polytope using tools from combinatorics and real algebraic geometry.  In particular, we show that the intersection body of a polytope is always a semialgebraic set and provide an algorithm for its computation.  Moreover, we compute the irreducible components of the algebraic boundary and provide an upper bound for the degree of these components.


Our MathRepo page contains lots of supplementary material:
- An implementation of an algorithm in `SageMath` to compute interseciton bodies of polytopes  
- A step by step explanation of the algorithm with the example of the cube  
- A gallery of 3d models that show how different intersection bodies can look like

Here are 2 of the 3d models that are in the gallery. [Click here so see them all!](https://mathrepo.mis.mpg.de/intersection-bodies/case-study.html)
