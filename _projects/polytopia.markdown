I was honoured to be part of [polytopia.eu](polytopia.eu), a math communication project to make polytopes accessible to a general audience. This project is associated to Collaborative Research Center [Discretization in Geometry and Dynamics](https://www.discretization.de/projects/CaP/), lead by [Anna Hartkopf](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/math/groups/discgeom/members/hartkopf.html). 

In polytopia, everyone can adopt a 3-dimensional polytope which is accompanied by a crafting sheet, with which it can be brought to life in the real world. On the website, the polytope is shown using `ThreeJS`, in which the user can customize the adopted polytope by coloring the faces. There is a also VR version using `Framework`. 
Additionally, there is teaching material for middle and high school classes, as well as a mini-game, in which one can find Hamiltonial cycles on the 1-skeleton of the polytope.

The implementation of the `ThreeJS`-viewer that is used to display the polytopes can be found [in this repository](https://github.com/mariebrandenburg/polytopia). It also contains the implementation of the VR viewer and the mini-game for finding Hamiltonian cycles.
