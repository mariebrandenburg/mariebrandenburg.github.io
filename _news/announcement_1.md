In January 2023 I will join [Guido Mont√∫far](https://personal-homepages.mis.mpg.de/montufar/)'s group [Mathematical Machine Learning](https://www.mis.mpg.de/montufar/index.html) at MPI MiS, as part of the [SPP 2298 Theoretical Foundations of Deep Learning: Combinatorial and Implicit Apporoaches to Deep Learning](https://www.spp2298.math.uni-muenchen.de/projects/index.html). I am very excited to learn a lot about the mathematics behind machine learning, and explore the connections of neural networks to combinatorics and tropical geometry in the upcoming year.
