      title={How to learn a star: Binary classification with starshaped polyhedral sets}, 
      author={Brandenburg, Marie-Charlotte  and Jochemko, Katharina},
      year={2025},
      arxiv={2505.01346},
      abstract={We consider binary classification restricted to a class of continuous piecewise linear functions whose decision boundaries are (possibly nonconvex) starshaped polyhedral sets, supported on a fixed polyhedral simplicial fan. We investigate the expressivity of these function classes and describe the combinatorial and geometric structure of the loss landscape, most prominently the sublevel sets, for two loss-functions: the 0/1-loss (discrete loss) and an exponential loss function. In particular, we give explicit bounds on the VC dimension of this model, and concretely describe the sublevel sets of the discrete loss as chambers in a hyperplane arrangement. For the exponential loss, we give sufficient conditions for the optimum to be unique, and describe the geometry of the optimum when varying the rate parameter of the underlying exponential probability distribution.},

      title={Quotients of M-convex sets and M-convex functions}, 
      author={Brandenburg, Marie-Charlotte  and Loho, Georg and Smith, Ben},
      year={2024},
      arxiv={2403.07751},
      abstract={We unify the study of quotients of matroids, polymatroids, valuated matroids and strong maps of submodular functions in the framework of Murota's discrete convex analysis. As a main result, we compile a list of ten equivalent characterizations of quotients for M-convex sets, generalizing existing formulations for (poly)matroids and submodular functions. We also initiate the study of quotients of M-convex functions, constructing a hierarchy of four separate characterizations. Our investigations yield new insights into the fundamental operation of induction, as well as the structure of linking sets and linking functions, which are generalizations of linking systems and bimatroids.},

      title={Veronese polytopes: Extending the framework of cyclic polytopes}, 
      author={Brandenburg, Marie-Charlotte  and P\'{u}\v{c}ek, Roland},
      year={2024},
      arxiv={2411.13702},
      abstract={This article introduces the theory of Veronese polytopes, a broad generalisation of cyclic polytopes.
      These arise as convex hulls of points on curves with one or more connected components, obtained as the image of the rational normal curve in affine charts.
      We describe their facial structure by extending Galeâ€™s evenness condition, and provide a further combinatorial characterisation of facets via $\sigma$-parity alternating sequences.
      Notably, we establish a bijective correspondence between combinatorial types of Veronese polytopes and partitions of finite sets equipped with a cyclic order, called circular compositions.
      We show  that, although the only Veronese $3$-polytopes are the cyclic $3$-polytopes and the octahedron, in general dimension they form a rich and diverse class including all combinatorial types of simplicial $d$-polytopes with at most $d+3$ vertices, the cross-polytope and particular stacked polytopes.
      In addition, we characterise which curves defining Veronese polytopes are $d$-order curves, and provide a closed formula for the number of facets of any Veronese polytope.},
