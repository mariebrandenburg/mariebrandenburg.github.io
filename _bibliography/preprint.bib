      title={Quotients of M-convex sets and M-convex functions}, 
      author={Brandenburg, Marie-Charlotte  and Loho, Georg and Smith, Ben},
      year={2024},
      arxiv={2403.07751},
      abstract={We unify the study of quotients of matroids, polymatroids, valuated matroids and strong maps of submodular functions in the framework of Murota's discrete convex analysis. As a main result, we compile a list of ten equivalent characterizations of quotients for M-convex sets, generalizing existing formulations for (poly)matroids and submodular functions. We also initiate the study of quotients of M-convex functions, constructing a hierarchy of four separate characterizations. Our investigations yield new insights into the fundamental operation of induction, as well as the structure of linking sets and linking functions, which are generalizations of linking systems and bimatroids.},

      title={Decomposition Polyhedra of Piecewise Linear Functions}, 
      author={Brandenburg, Marie-Charlotte  and Grillo, Moritz and Hertrich, Christoph},
      year={2024},
      arxiv={2410.04907},
      abstract={In this paper we contribute to the frequently studied question of how to decompose a continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) function into a difference of two convex CPWL functions. Every CPWL function has infinitely many such decompositions, but for applications in optimization and neural network theory, it is crucial to find decompositions with as few linear pieces as possible. This is a highly challenging problem, as we further demonstrate by disproving a recently proposed approach by Tran and Wang [Minimal representations of tropical rational functions. Algebraic Statistics, 15(1):27-59, 2024]. To make the problem more tractable, we propose to fix an underlying polyhedral complex determining the possible locus of nonlinearity. Under this assumption, we prove that the set of decompositions forms a polyhedron that arises as intersection of two translated cones. We prove that irreducible decompositions correspond to the bounded faces of this polyhedron and minimal solutions must be vertices. We then identify cases with a unique minimal decomposition, and illustrate how our insights have consequences in the theory of submodular functions. Finally, we improve upon previous constructions of neural networks for a given convex CPWL function and apply our framework to obtain results in the nonconvex case.},

      title={Veronese polytopes: Extending the framework of cyclic polytopes}, 
      author={Brandenburg, Marie-Charlotte  and P\'{u}\v{c}ek, Roland},
      year={2024},
      arxiv={2411.13702},
      abstract={This article introduces the theory of Veronese polytopes, a broad generalisation of cyclic polytopes.
      These arise as convex hulls of points on curves with one or more connected components, obtained as the image of the rational normal curve in affine charts.
      We describe their facial structure by extending Galeâ€™s evenness condition, and provide a further combinatorial characterisation of facets via $\sigma$-parity alternating sequences.
      Notably, we establish a bijective correspondence between combinatorial types of Veronese polytopes and partitions of finite sets equipped with a cyclic order, called circular compositions.
      We show  that, although the only Veronese $3$-polytopes are the cyclic $3$-polytopes and the octahedron, in general dimension they form a rich and diverse class including all combinatorial types of simplicial $d$-polytopes with at most $d+3$ vertices, the cross-polytope and particular stacked polytopes.
      In addition, we characterise which curves defining Veronese polytopes are $d$-order curves, and provide a closed formula for the number of facets of any Veronese polytope.},
