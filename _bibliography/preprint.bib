      abstract={We present a complete computational classification of the combinatorial types of hyperplane sections, or slices, of the regular cube up to dimension six. For each dimension, we determine the exact number of distinct combinatorial types. When restricted to slices through the origin, our computations extend to dimension seven. The classification combines combinatorial, algebraic, and numerical techniques, with all results certified. Beyond enumeration, we analyze the distribution of types by number of vertices, establish new theoretical results about the combinatorics of slices of cubes, and propose conjectures motivated by our computational findings.},

      title={Veronese polytopes: Extending the framework of cyclic polytopes}, 
      author={Brandenburg, Marie-Charlotte  and P\'{u}\v{c}ek, Roland},
      year={2024},
      arxiv={2411.13702},
      abstract={This article introduces the theory of Veronese polytopes, a broad generalisation of cyclic polytopes.
      These arise as convex hulls of points on curves with one or more connected components, obtained as the image of the rational normal curve in affine charts.
      We describe their facial structure by extending Galeâ€™s evenness condition, and provide a further combinatorial characterisation of facets via $\sigma$-parity alternating sequences.
      Notably, we establish a bijective correspondence between combinatorial types of Veronese polytopes and partitions of finite sets equipped with a cyclic order, called circular compositions.
      We show  that, although the only Veronese $3$-polytopes are the cyclic $3$-polytopes and the octahedron, in general dimension they form a rich and diverse class including all combinatorial types of simplicial $d$-polytopes with at most $d+3$ vertices, the cross-polytope and particular stacked polytopes.
      In addition, we characterise which curves defining Veronese polytopes are $d$-order curves, and provide a closed formula for the number of facets of any Veronese polytope.},
