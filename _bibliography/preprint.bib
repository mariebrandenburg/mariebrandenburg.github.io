      abstract={We consider a binary classifier defined as the sign of a tropical rational function, that is, as the difference of two convex piecewise linear functions. The parameter space of ReLU neural networks is contained as a semialgebraic set inside the parameter space of tropical rational functions. We initiate the study of two different subdivisions of this parameter space: a subdivision into semialgebraic sets, on which the combinatorial type of the decision boundary is fixed, and a subdivision into a polyhedral fan, capturing the combinatorics of the partitions of the dataset. The sublevel sets of the 0/1-loss function arise as subfans of this classification fan, and we show that the level-sets are not necessarily connected. We describe the classification fan i) geometrically, as normal fan of the activation polytope, and ii) combinatorially through a list of properties of associated bipartite graphs, in analogy to covector axioms of oriented matroids and tropical oriented matroids. Our findings extend and refine the connection between neural networks and tropical geometry by observing structures established in real tropical geometry, such as positive tropicalizations of hypersurfaces and tropical semialgebraic sets.},

      title={Quotients of M-convex sets and M-convex functions}, 
      author={Brandenburg, Marie-Charlotte  and Loho, Georg and Smith, Ben},
      year={2024},
      arxiv={2403.07751},
      abstract={We unify the study of quotients of matroids, polymatroids, valuated matroids and strong maps of submodular functions in the framework of Murota's discrete convex analysis. As a main result, we compile a list of ten equivalent characterizations of quotients for M-convex sets, generalizing existing formulations for (poly)matroids and submodular functions. We also initiate the study of quotients of M-convex functions, constructing a hierarchy of four separate characterizations. Our investigations yield new insights into the fundamental operation of induction, as well as the structure of linking sets and linking functions, which are generalizations of linking systems and bimatroids.},

      title={The Best Ways to Slice a Polytope}, 
      author={Brandenburg, Marie-Charlotte and {de Loera}, Jes\'us A. and Chiara Meroni},
      year={2023},
      arxiv={2304.14239},
      abstract = {We study the structure of the set of all possible affine hyperplane sections of a convex polytope. We present two different cell decompositions of this set, induced by hyperplane arrangements. Using our decomposition, we bound the number of possible combinatorial types of sections and craft algorithms that compute optimal sections of the polytope according to various combinatorial and metric criteria, including sections that maximize the number of $k$-dimensional faces, maximize the volume, and maximize the integral of a polynomial. Our optimization algorithms run in polynomial time in fixed dimension, but the same problems show hardness otherwise. Our tools can be extended to intersection with halfspaces and projections onto hyperplanes. Finally, we present several experiments illustrating our theorems and algorithms on famous polytopes.},
