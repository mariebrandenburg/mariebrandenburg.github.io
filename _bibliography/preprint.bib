      abstract = {We study the structure of the set of all possible affine hyperplane sections of a convex polytope. We present two different cell decompositions of this set, induced by hyperplane arrangements. Using our decomposition, we bound the number of possible combinatorial types of sections and craft algorithms that compute optimal sections of the polytope according to various combinatorial and metric criteria, including sections that maximize the number of $k$-dimensional faces, maximize the volume, and maximize the integral of a polynomial. Our optimization algorithms run in polynomial time in fixed dimension, but the same problems show hardness otherwise. Our tools can be extended to intersection with halfspaces and projections onto hyperplanes. Finally, we present several experiments illustrating our theorems and algorithms on famous polytopes.},

      title={Intersection Bodies of Polytopes: Translations and Convexity}, 
      author={Brandenburg, Marie-Charlotte and Chiara Meroni},
      year={2023},
      arxiv={2302.11764},
      abstract = {We continue the study of intersection bodies of polytopes, focusing on the behavior of $IP$ under translations of $P$. We introduce an affine hyperplane arrangement and show that the polynomials describing the boundary of $I(P+t)$ can be extended to polynomials in variables $t \in \mathbb{R}^d$ within each region of the arrangement. Establishing the convexity space as the set of translations such that $I(P+t)$ is convex, we fully characterize it for two-dimensional polytopes and partially characterize it for higher dimensions, revealing unexpected finite behavior in the two-dimensional case and for the $d$-dimensional cube.},

  title = {Combinatorics of Correlated Equilibria},
  author = {Brandenburg, Marie-Charlotte and Hollering, Benjamin and Irem Portakal},
  year = {2022},
  arxiv={2209.13938},
  abstract={We study the correlated equilibrium polytope $P_G$ of a game $G$ from a combinatorial point of view. We introduce the region of full-dimensionality for this class of polytopes, and prove that it is a semialgebraic set for any game. Through the use of the oriented matroid strata, we propose a structured method for describing the possible combinatorial types of $P_G$, and show that for $(2 \times n)$-games, the algebraic boundary of each stratum is the union of coordinate hyperplanes and binomial hypersurfaces. Finally, we provide a computational proof that there exists a unique combinatorial type of maximal dimension for $(2\times 3)$-games.},
