  abstract={We study the correlated equilibrium polytope $P_G$ of a game $G$ from a combinatorial point of view. We introduce the region of full-dimensionality for this class of polytopes, and prove that it is a semialgebraic set for any game. Through the use of the oriented matroid strata, we propose a structured method for describing the possible combinatorial types of $P_G$, and show that for $(2 \times n)$-games, the algebraic boundary of each stratum is the union of coordinate hyperplanes and binomial hypersurfaces. Finally, we provide a computational proof that there exists a unique combinatorial type of maximal dimension for $(2\times 3)$-games.},

Applying this to the tropicalization of determinantal varieties, we develop criteria for characterizing their positive part. We focus on the study of low-rank matrices, in particular matrices of rank 2 and 3. Moreover, in the case square-matrices of corank 1, we fully classify the signed tropicalization of the determinantal variety, even beyond the positive part.},

      abstract = {We show that a competitive equilibrium always exists in combinatorial auctions with anonymous graphical valuations and pricing, using discrete geometry. This is an intuitive and easy-to-construct class of valuations that can model both complementarity and substitutes, and to our knowledge, it is the first class besides gross substitutes that have guaranteed competitive equilibrium. We prove through counter-examples that our result is tight, and we give explicit algorithms for constructive competitive pricing vectors. We also give extensions to multi-unit combinatorial auctions (also known as product-mix auctions). Combined with theorems on graphical valuations and pricing equilibrium of Candogan, Ozdagar and Parrilo, our results indicate that quadratic pricing is a highly practical method to run combinatorial auctions.},

We describe methods from toric geometry for computing multivariate versions of volume, Ehrhart and \(h^*\)-polynomials of lattice polytropes, which are both tropically and classically convex. These algorithms are applied to all polytropes of dimensions 2,3 and 4, yielding a large class of integer polynomials. We give a complete combinatorial description of the coefficients of volume polynomials of 3-dimensional polytropes in terms of regular central subdivisions of the fundamental polytope. Finally, we provide a partial characterization of the analogous coefficients in dimension 4.},

	abstract = {To realistically simulate fluid flow in fractured rock mass, a scheme to represent the discrete fracture networks (DFN) in the numerical model is of utmost importance. In this paper we discuss a workflow to implement a field-measurement based DFN into an FEM code (COMSOL Multiphysics) by means of a MATLAB routine. This workflow is involved in the ZoKrateS project which aims at showing the feasibility to enhanced fractured carbonate Rock Mass by proppant placement for geothermal application.
	The model generation is based on analytical geometry including the equations for dip, azimuth and spacing of lines. The spacing between the discontinuities and the characteristic fracture length and aperture as well as orientation serve as input parameters for the model. It is possible to generate periodic models to be able to include periodic boundary conditions in simulations. In 2D the fractures are modeled as poroelastic ellipses in a poroelastic square- matrix. We investigate hydro-mechanically triggered fluid transport in stationary fractures that are mechanically and hydraulically active.
	An extension to 3D fracture networks requires an algorithm based on analytical geometry including the equations for azimuth, dip and spacing of planes. To decrease the numerical costs of the 3D simulation a diffuse interface approach is strived for, including a modified model generation.
	With the numerical model generator (NUMOG) a workflow is developed which allows numerical investigations of (thermo-) hydro-mechanically triggered fluid transport in a geothermal reservoir.},
