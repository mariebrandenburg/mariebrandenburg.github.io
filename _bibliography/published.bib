      abstract={In this paper we contribute to the frequently studied question of how to decompose a continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) function into a difference of two convex CPWL functions. Every CPWL function has infinitely many such decompositions, but for applications in optimization and neural network theory, it is crucial to find decompositions with as few linear pieces as possible. This is a highly challenging problem, as we further demonstrate by disproving a recently proposed approach by Tran and Wang [Minimal representations of tropical rational functions. Algebraic Statistics, 15(1):27-59, 2024]. To make the problem more tractable, we propose to fix an underlying polyhedral complex determining the possible locus of nonlinearity. Under this assumption, we prove that the set of decompositions forms a polyhedron that arises as intersection of two translated cones. We prove that irreducible decompositions correspond to the bounded faces of this polyhedron and minimal solutions must be vertices. We then identify cases with a unique minimal decomposition, and illustrate how our insights have consequences in the theory of submodular functions. Finally, we improve upon previous constructions of neural networks for a given convex CPWL function and apply our framework to obtain results in the nonconvex case.},

      abstract = {We consider a binary classifier defined as the sign of a tropical rational function, that is, as the difference of two convex piecewise linear functions. In particular, the set of functions represented by a ReLU neural network can be regarded as a subset in the parameter space of tropical rational functions, specifically, it is contained as a semialgebraic set. We initiate the study of two different subdivisions of the parameter space of tropical rational functions with fixed number of terms in the numerator and denominator: a subdivision into semialgebraic sets, on which the combinatorial type of the decision boundary is fixed, and a subdivision into a polyhedral fan, capturing the combinatorics of the partitions of the dataset. The sublevel sets of the 0/1-loss function arise as subfans of this classification fan, and we show that the level-sets are not necessarily connected. We describe the classification fan i) geometrically, as normal fan of the activation polytope, and ii) combinatorially through a list of properties of associated bipartite graphs, in analogy to covector axioms of oriented matroids and tropical oriented matroids. Our findings extend and refine the connection between neural networks and tropical geometry by observing structures established in real tropical geometry, such as positive tropicalizations of hypersurfaces and tropical semialgebraic sets.},

Our optimization algorithms run in polynomial time in fixed dimension, but the same problems show hardness otherwise. Our tools can be extended to intersection with halfspaces and projections onto hyperplanes. Finally, we present several experiments illustrating our theorems and algorithms on famous polytopes.},

This is an intuitive and easy-to-construct class of valuations that can model both complementarity and substitutes, and to our knowledge, it is the first class besides gross substitutes that have guaranteed competitive equilibrium. We prove through counter-examples that our result is tight, and we give explicit algorithms for constructive competitive pricing vectors. We also give extensions to multi-unit combinatorial auctions (also known as product-mix auctions). Combined with theorems on graphical valuations and pricing equilibrium of Candogan, Ozdagar and Parrilo, our results indicate that quadratic pricing is a highly practical method to run combinatorial auctions.},

	abstract = {To realistically simulate fluid flow in fractured rock mass, a scheme to represent the discrete fracture networks (DFN) in the numerical model is of utmost importance. In this paper we discuss a workflow to implement a field-measurement based DFN into an FEM code (COMSOL Multiphysics) by means of a MATLAB routine. This workflow is involved in the ZoKrateS project which aims at showing the feasibility to enhanced fractured carbonate Rock Mass by proppant placement for geothermal application.
	The model generation is based on analytical geometry including the equations for dip, azimuth and spacing of lines. The spacing between the discontinuities and the characteristic fracture length and aperture as well as orientation serve as input parameters for the model. It is possible to generate periodic models to be able to include periodic boundary conditions in simulations. In 2D the fractures are modeled as poroelastic ellipses in a poroelastic square- matrix. We investigate hydro-mechanically triggered fluid transport in stationary fractures that are mechanically and hydraulically active.
	An extension to 3D fracture networks requires an algorithm based on analytical geometry including the equations for azimuth, dip and spacing of planes. To decrease the numerical costs of the 3D simulation a diffuse interface approach is strived for, including a modified model generation.
	With the numerical model generator (NUMOG) a workflow is developed which allows numerical investigations of (thermo-) hydro-mechanically triggered fluid transport in a geothermal reservoir.},
