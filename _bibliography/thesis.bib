	abstract = {
		A competitive equilibrium is an envy-free allocation of goods. That is, given a price function that assigns a nonnegative value to each bundle of items, each agent prefers the allocated bundle to every other affordable bundle of goods, or is indifferent towards them. It is further required that the allocation clears the market, i.e. each item is allocated to exactly one agent. There is a particular interest in economics in conditions on the existence of a competitive equilibrium for indivisible goods. In a recent work, Condogan et al. study such conditions in the setting of graphical valuations, which is a class of valuations associated to a value graph, whose nodes correspond to items and whose edges encode (pairwise) complementarities or substitutabilities between items.
		We explore a connection between these graphical valuations and regular subdivisions of a polytope that can be constructed from the value graph. We show that a competitive equilibrium exists for all sets of valuations and any bundle of indivisible goods, provided that, in the setting of anonymous graphical pricing, the value graphs of all agents correspond to complete graphs.

	title={Bachelor Thesis: A 4-Simple 4-Simplicial 8-Polytope},
	author={Bachelor Thesis},

	journal={Advisor: GÃ¼nter M. Ziegler},
	abstract = {
		The Gosset polytope $2_{41}$ is - besides the simplices of dimension 4 and higher - the only 4-simple, 4-simplicial polytope known to date. We discuss its construction via the Wythoff construction and the underlying reflection group E8. We also consider the exceptional root system E8 and the fundamental properties of the polytope: 4-simplicity, 4-simplicialty and its f-vector.},
